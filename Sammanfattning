#Tuples

  examplePair :: (Double, Bool)
  examplePair = (3.14, False)

  exampleTriple :: (Bool, Int, String)
  exampleTriple = (False, 42, "Answer")

  exampleFunction :: (Bool, Int, string) -> Bool
  exampleFunction (b, i, s) = not b && length s<i

#Lists

    * For any tpe x, [x] is the type of lists of x's
      e.g [Bool] is the type of lists of Bool

    * [] empty list (nil)

    * x:xs, x has type A and xs has type [A].
      x = the head
      : cons
      xs = the tail


    List shorthands
    * 1:(2:(3:[])) == 1:2:3:[], [1,2,3], [1..3]

    Functions over lists
    * can use pattern matching

    * summerize :: [String] -> String
      summerize [] = "None"
      summerize [x] = "Only " ++ x
      summerize _ = "Several things." (don't care pattern)

    * primitive recursion is most used
      doubles :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
      doubles [] = []]
      doubles (x:xs)

    * map applying f to each element
      map f [x1, x2, xn] = [f x1, f x2, f xn]
      map f[] = []
      map f(x:xs) = fx : map f xs

    * filter - removing all elements that don't have a certain property

    * List comprehensions
      [2*n | n<- [10..12]]

#Modelling Data

  data Suit = Spades | Hearts | Diamonds | Clubs
  deriving Show
  - needs in order to print the values

  colour :: Suit -> Colour
  colour Spades = Black
  colour Hearts = Red
  colour Diamonds = Red
  colour Clubs = Black


#Property
  prop_rankBeats a b = rankBeats a b || rankBeats b a

  quickCheck can't be used since it doesn't know how to use arbitrary Rank

  We have to change it to:
  data Rank = Numeric Integer | Jack | Queen | King | Ace
  deriving (Show,Eq)
    define show and == for rank

  prop_ranksBeats a b = a/=b ==> rankBeats a b || rankBeats b a

# QuickCheck Generators
  test data is chosen by a test data generator

#Modelling Card

  data Card = Card Rank Suit
    deriving Show

  rank :: Card -> Rank
  rank (Card r s) = r

  suit :: Card -> Suit
  suit (Card r s) = s

  * data Card = Card{rank :: Rank, suit :: Suit}
    deriving Show

#Modelling a Hand of Cards

  data Hand = Empty | Add Card Hand
    deriving Show

#Define lists as a datatype
    * data List a = Empty | Add a (List a)

    * (++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]

    * Example Quicksort
      qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
      qsort [] = []
      qsort(x1:xs) = qsort smaller ++ [x1] ++ qsort greater
        where
          smaller = [x | x<-x1, x<x1]
          greater = [y | y<-x1, y>x1]

      Ord a means sort lists of any type a, as long as a has comparison functions

#Do's and don'ts
  isBig :: Integer -> Bool
  isBig n | n > 999 = True
          | otherwise = False
          guards and boolean results, instead
          n>999

  resultIsSmall :: Integer -> Bool
  resultIsSmall n = isSmall (f n) == True
  resultIsSmall n = isSmall (f n)

# What is a higher order function?
  a function which takes another function as a parameter

  even :: Int -> Bool
  even n = n `mod` 2 ==0

  filter :: (Int -> Bool) -> [Int] -> [Int]

#Curried functions
    Int -> Int -> Int (two ints return an int)
    a function that takes multiple arguments into sequence of functions, each with a single argument

#Partially applied
  a function that takes as many parameters as we left out


  * Case Study: Summing a List
    sum[] = 0
    sum(x:xs) = x + sum xs


    foldr op z []= z
    foldr op z (x:xs) = x `op` foldr op z xs


    sum xs = foldr plus 0 xs
       where plus x y = x + y

    sum xs = foldr(+) 0 xs

# λ-expressions
  inline expression

    reverse xs = foldr snoc[] xs
    where snoc y ys = ys ++ [y]

    instead:
    reverse xs = foldr(\y ys -> ys++[y]) [] xs

    example
    unlines["abc", "def", "ghi"] = "abc\ndef\nghi\n"

    unlines[xs, ys, zs] = xs ++ "\n"++ (ys ++ "\n" ++ (zs ++ "\n" ++ []))

    unlines xss = foldr(λ xs ys -> xs ++ "\n" ++ ys)[] xss
    same as (xss defines two lists)
    unlines xss = foldr join [] xss
      where join xs ys = xs ++ "\n" ++ ys

#Sections
    map(+1)[1,2,3]=[2,3,4]
    (a•)b = a•b
    (•a)b = b•a

#Function composition

  (f . g) x = f(g x)

#Pure functions
  * no side effects
  * same argument => same results
  * debugging and testing


#IO
  * IO actions is not pure since they can be changed and return different results
  * interacts with the "outside world"

#Instructions vs Functions
  * Function /= Instructions
    Instructions can behave differently on different occasions

#Example to get access to the results from IO-actions
  * s= readFile "hello.txt" doesn't work -> two equal interchangeable things of same type

  getTheDifference :: IO Integer
  getTheDifference = do x <- readLn
                        y <- readLn
                        return (x-y)

  showTheDifference :: IO ()
  showTheDifference = do d <- getTheDifference
                          putStr "The difference is: "
                          print d

  copyFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO()
  copyFile from to = do s <- readFile from
                        writeFile to s

  sortFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO()
  sortFile from to = do s <- readFile from
                        writeFile to (sortLines s)

  sortLines = unlines . sort . lines

#Type classes and instances

  * type class - declares a set of methods
    class Num a where (+), (* ), (-) :: a -> a -> a
    negate, abs, signum :: a -> a
    fromInteger :: Integer -> a

  * instance declaration - provides implementations of methods for a specific type
    instance Eq TrafficLight where
    Red    == Red    = True
    Yellow == Yellow = True
    Green  == Green  = True
    _      == _      = False

  * Equality instance for pairs
    instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Eq (a,b) where (x1, y1) == (x2, y2) = x1 == x2 && y1 == y2

  * Equality instance for lists
      instance Eq a => Eq [a] where
      [] == [] = True
      x:xs == y:ys x==y && xs == ys
      _ == _ = False

  * The Ord class
    subclass of Eq
    data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT

  * The Enum class
    enumerations

  * Bounded class
    enumAll : (Bounded a, Enum a) => [a]
    enumAll = [minBound..maxBound]

    Bool, Char, Int, Tuples

  * Show and Read

   * examlpes
   data Suit = Spades | Hearts | Diamonds | Clubs
            deriving (Eq,Ord, Show, Read, Enum, Bounded)

    instance Show Suit where
      show Spades   = "♠"
      show Hearts   = "♥"
      show Diamonds = "♦"
      show Clubs    = "♣"

    data Rank = Numeric Int | Jack | Queen | King | Ace
            deriving (Eq,Ord, Show, Read, Enum, Bounded)

    instance Show Rank where
      show (Numeric n) = show n
      show Jack        = "J"
      show Queen       = "Q"
      show King        = "K"
      show Ace         = "A"

    data Card = Card{rank::Rank, suit::Suit}

    instance Show Card where
      show (Card r s) = show r ++ show s

  * defining own class
    class Small a where
      values :: [a]

    instance Small Bool where
      values = [False, True]

    instance Small Suit where
      values = [maxBound..minBound]


  # Monomorphism restriction
    definitions without arguments and without type signatures are not allowed to be overloaded

------------- Lecture 3B Generators -------------

  * QuickCheck perform random testing with values of any type in class Arbitrary
   Any type in Arbitrary, random value generator Gen a

  * Gen is a Monad

  * Generating a Rank
    sample rRank
    rRank = oneOf [return Jack,
                   return King,
                   return Ace,
                   ....
                   do r <- choose(2,10) return (Numeric r)]

  * have to make our types instances of this class
    instance Arbitrary Suit where
    arbitrary = rSuit


#Testing
  - Generators only produce values satifying the datatype     invariant

  * Test Data Distribution
    prop_Rank r = collect r(validRank r)
    - returns a summary, showing how often each value occured

    - rRank = frequence
                [(1, return Jack), 9,
                do r<- choose(2,10)..]
      choose number cards 9x as often

  * Testing insert
    prop_insert_1 :: Integer -> [Integer] -> Bool
    prop_insert_1 x xs = isOrdered (insert x xs)
    --> Bad because if the input list isn't ordered the output list won't be ordered

    property_insert_2 :: Integer -> [Integer] -> Property
    prop_insert_2 x xs = isOrdered xs ==> isOrdered(insert x xs)
    --> Bad because the proability that a random list is ordered is very low

    - testing ordered lists
    orderedList :: Gen [Integer]
    orderedList =
                do n <- arbitrary
                  listFrom n
                where listFrom n =
                      frequency [(1, return []),
                      (5, do i <- arbitrary
                            ns <- listFrom (n+abs i)
                            return (n:ns))]

    data OrderedList = Ordered[Integer]
      deriving Show

    instance Arbitrary OrderedList where
      arbitrary = do xs <- orderedList
          return(Ordered xs)

    prop_insert_3 x = forAll orderedList (\xs -> isOrdered(insert x xs))

    prop_insert_4 x (Ordered xs) = isOrdered (insert x xs)
